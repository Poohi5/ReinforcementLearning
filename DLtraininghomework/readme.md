ConvNet Pytorch example

The accuracy of the model 98.91 %

He Initialization

After applying He initialization, the accuracy of the model - 99.01 %

Nadam Optimizer

After using Nadam Optimizer, the accuracy of the model - 98.91%

Using both He Initialization and Nadam Optimizer

The accuracy of the model - 98.91 %

From the above achieved accuracies, by applying He initialization which is weight initialization to the Deep Learning Convnet for MNIST dataset showed the model achieving higher accuracy of 99.01%.
